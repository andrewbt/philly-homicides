### Visualizing PhillyTreeMap User Contributions over time

Four visualizations that use data from PhillyTreeMap and the [CartoDB Torque.js](http://github.com/cartodb/torque/) library to display user contributions of trees and tree planting sites (plots) in and around Philadelphia from 06/21/2011 - 07/24/2012.

[PhillyTreeMap.org](http://www.phillytreemap.org/) is an implementation of the open source (GPL) [OpenTreeMap](http://github.com/azavea/OpenTreeMap] project, a comprehensive web application developed by [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com/) in collaboration with many partners, designed to leverage crowdsourcing and citizen science for accurate, efficient, and collaborative urban forestry inventories and eco-benefit calculation.

Andrew Thompson (Community Evangelist at Azavea) authored these maps in conjunction with the [Azavea Labs](http://www.azavea.com/blogs/labs/) blog series, "Open Data from OpenTreeMap". Credit is due to Mark Headd, whose [philly-homicides](http://github.com/mheadd/philly-homicides/) project provided a starting point and inspiration.
